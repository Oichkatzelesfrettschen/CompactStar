\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Lightweight base providing naming and work-\/directory handling. 

This version removes banner printing and custom new/delete from the constructor path. The banner is now handled by Banner.\+cpp at program startup. {\ttfamily Prog} focuses on opt-\/in capabilities that many classes need\+: name, working directory, and a hook to propagate directory changes to member objects.
