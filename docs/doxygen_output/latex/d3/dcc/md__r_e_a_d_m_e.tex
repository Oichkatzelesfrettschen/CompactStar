{\bfseries{Compact\+Star}} is a modular C++ framework for modeling the structure of compact stars, including neutron stars and dark-\/visible admixed configurations. ~\newline
 It supports both tabulated and analytical equations of state (EOS), and includes solvers for the Tolman–\+Oppenheimer–\+Volkoff (TOV) and Hartle equations.

The code is designed for flexibility and extensibility, with integrated modules for physics, mathematics, file I/O, and analysis of astrophysical data.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Features}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md4}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Supports tabulated and analytical EOS formats
\item Solves relativistic stellar structure equations (TOV \& Hartle)
\item Models hybrid stars with visible and dark matter
\item Built-\/in support for sequences, contours, and profile exports
\item Lightweight dependencies (GSL, C++17)
\item Modular structure for easy extension
