/**
 * @file StarBuilder.hpp
 * @brief Utilities to construct a neutron-star structural profile from
 *        sequence TSVs (the files you already export from the TOV pipeline).
 *
 * This is the code that used to live in `Pulsar::FindProfile(...)`, but made
 * standalone so that:
 *
 *  1. Pulsar doesn't have to know how profiles are built.
 *  2. MixedStar / NStar / BNV / Thermal code can all reuse the same logic.
 *  3. We can later add other builders (from TOVSolver directly, from JSON,
 *     from MHD runs, etc.) without touching the core containers.
 *
 * The builder does the following:
 *
 *  - load `<wrk_dir><rel_dir><model_name>_Sequence.tsv`
 *  - find the closest mass to the requested one
 *  - if we're at the high-mass end, just load that profile
 *  - otherwise, linearly interpolate *between* the two neighboring profiles
 *    (your original logic: pick the shorter profile's radial grid, interpolate
 *     the longer one to it, then blend column-by-column)
 *  - compute `eta_I` using the derivatives in the sequence file
 *  - locate the blanket radius (by energy density)
 *  - build a DUrca “mask” column using your Fermi-momentum condition
 *
 * You can then *move* the resulting `Zaki::Vector::DataSet` into your
 * `StarProfile` or whatever container you’re using at the call site.
